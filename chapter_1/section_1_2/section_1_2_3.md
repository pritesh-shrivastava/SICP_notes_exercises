## Section 1.2.3

#### Ex1.14

Draw the tree illustrating the process generated by the count-change procedure of 1.2.2 in making change for 11 cents. 
What are the orders of growth of the space and number of steps used by this process as the amount to be changed increases?

```
(define (count-change amount)
  (cc amount 5))

(define (cc amount kinds-of-coins)
  (cond ((= amount 0) 1)
        ((or (< amount 0) 
             (= kinds-of-coins 0)) 
         0)
        (else 
         (+ (cc amount (- kinds-of-coins 1))
            (cc (- amount (first-denomination 
                           kinds-of-coins))
                kinds-of-coins)))))

(define (first-denomination kinds-of-coins)
  (cond ((= kinds-of-coins 1) 1)
        ((= kinds-of-coins 2) 5)
        ((= kinds-of-coins 3) 10)
        ((= kinds-of-coins 4) 25)
        ((= kinds-of-coins 5) 50)))
``` 
_Solution_ : Recursive tree is plotted [here](https://codology.net/post/sicp-solution-exercise-1-14/)

Order of growth for space is theta(n)
Order of growth for no of steps is theta(n * (n-1st denom) * (n-2nd denom) * (n-3rd denom) * (n-4th denom)) or theta(n^5)
