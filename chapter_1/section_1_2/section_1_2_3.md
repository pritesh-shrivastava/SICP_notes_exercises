## Section 1.2.3

#### Ex1.14

Draw the tree illustrating the process generated by the count-change procedure of 1.2.2 in making change for 11 cents. 
What are the orders of growth of the space and number of steps used by this process as the amount to be changed increases?

```
(define (count-change amount)
  (cc amount 5))

(define (cc amount kinds-of-coins)
  (cond ((= amount 0) 1)
        ((or (< amount 0) 
             (= kinds-of-coins 0)) 
         0)
        (else 
         (+ (cc amount (- kinds-of-coins 1))
            (cc (- amount (first-denomination 
                           kinds-of-coins))
                kinds-of-coins)))))

(define (first-denomination kinds-of-coins)
  (cond ((= kinds-of-coins 1) 1)
        ((= kinds-of-coins 2) 5)
        ((= kinds-of-coins 3) 10)
        ((= kinds-of-coins 4) 25)
        ((= kinds-of-coins 5) 50)))
``` 
_Solution_ : Recursive tree is plotted [here](https://codology.net/post/sicp-solution-exercise-1-14/)

Order of growth for space is proportional to the height of the tree => amount to be changed => theta(n) or O(n)

Order of growth for no of steps is theta(n * (n-1st denom) * (n-2nd denom) * (n-3rd denom) * (n-4th denom)) or theta(n^5)
Each denomination creates a separate subtree => O(n^k) where k= no of denominations

#### Ex1.15

The sine of an angle (specified in radians) can be computed by making use of the approximation sinx≈x if x is sufficiently small, and the trigonometric identity
sinx=3sin(x/3)−4sin^3(x/3)
to reduce the size of the argument of sin. 
For purposes of this exercise an angle is considered “sufficiently small” if its magnitude is not greater than 0.1 radians.
These ideas are incorporated in the following procedures:
```
(define (cube x) (* x x x))
(define (p x) (- (* 3 x) (* 4 (cube x))))
(define (sine angle)
   (if (not (> (abs angle) 0.1))
       angle
       (p (sine (/ angle 3.0)))))
```
1. How many times is the procedure p applied when (sine 12.15) is evaluated?
2. What is the order of growth in space and number of steps (as a function of a) used by the process generated by the sine procedure when (sine a) is evaluated?

_Solution_ : 
Part 1 - sin(12.15) -> p(sin(4.05)) -> p(p(sin(1.35))) -> p(p(p(sin(.45)))) -> p(p(p(p(sin(.15))))) -> p(p(p(p(p(sin(.05))))))

Part 2 - 
The procedure is applied 5 times, and in general, it's roughly the no of times we divide n by 3 to get <= 0.1 value or
the no of times we multiply a no <= 0.1 by 3 to get a no equal to n, which is log(n) base 3.

Order of growth of no of steps = O(log(n))
Order of growth of space = O(log(n))
